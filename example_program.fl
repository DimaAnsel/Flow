This program takes in a single line of input and then prints it out.
It starts from the hash and looks for a direction (in this case, right).
the variable gg is loaded. Then, the flow direction changes to up.
The program gets a character input and stores it in gg, then compares the
loaded variable (gg) to 0A, or the newline char '\n'. If they are the same,
the program prints the newline and exits. Elsewise, gg is printed and
another character input is obtained.
